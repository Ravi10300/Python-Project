## Customer Segmentation Analysis
This project focuses on Customer Segmentation, using data from Kaggle to group customers based on shared characteristics. The goal is to help businesses tailor their marketing strategies to different customer segments. The analysis was done using Python, Excel, and Jupyter Notebook.

### Project Overview
Customer segmentation helps businesses understand and target specific customer groups. In this project, we:

### Preprocessed the data.
Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA).
Applied clustering algorithms to create customer segments.
#### Dataset Information
The dataset contains several customer-related features (replace with your datasetâ€™s specific features). The data was cleaned and prepared in Excel before analysis in Python.

### Data Analysis Steps
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, data transformation, and feature creation.
EDA: Visualized the data to identify trends and correlations.
Clustering: Used K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering to segment customers.
Results
The analysis identified X customer segments, each with unique characteristics that can be used for targeted marketing strategies.

## Conclusion
This project successfully segmented customers, providing valuable insights that businesses can use to enhance customer engagement.
